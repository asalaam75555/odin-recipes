    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div>
    <p>
        Preparing a burger starts with selecting quality ground beef, ideally with a fat content of around 80/20 for a juicy, flavorful patty. The meat is gently shaped into patties, being careful not to overwork it, which can make the burger tough. Seasoning is usually simpleâ€”just salt and pepper on both sides right before cooking. The grill or skillet should be preheated to a high temperature so the patties can sear properly, creating a delicious crust. The burgers are cooked for a few minutes on each side, depending on the desired level of doneness, and cheese can be added in the final minute to melt. While the patties cook, burger buns can be lightly toasted on the grill for extra flavor and texture. Once the burgers are ready, they are assembled with desired toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise. The result is a hot, juicy burger with a great balance of texture and flavor, perfect for serving with fries, salad, or any favorite side.
