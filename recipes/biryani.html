    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div>
    <p>
        Biryani is a rich and aromatic rice dish made by layering marinated meat and fragrant basmati rice, often cooked together with a blend of spices. The preparation begins by marinating meat—usually chicken, mutton, or beef—with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, and a mix of spices like turmeric, chili powder, garam masala, and coriander. While the meat marinates, basmati rice is partially cooked with whole spices such as bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves to infuse it with flavor. In a heavy-bottomed pot, the marinated meat is placed at the bottom, followed by a layer of the parboiled rice. Fried onions, saffron soaked in warm milk, fresh herbs like mint and coriander, and a drizzle of ghee are added between layers for richness and aroma. The pot is then sealed—traditionally with dough—to trap the steam, and the biryani is cooked on low heat (dum method) until the meat is tender and the rice is fully done. Once ready, it is gently mixed before serving to preserve the layers. Biryani is often served hot with raita, salad, or boiled eggs on the side.
