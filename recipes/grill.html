    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        To prepare a grill for cooking, start by thoroughly cleaning the grates to remove any old food particles or residue, which helps prevent sticking and ensures a clean flavor. Make sure the fuel source is ready—this means having enough charcoal for a charcoal grill or checking the propane level or gas line for a gas grill. When using a charcoal grill, arrange and light the coals, allowing them to heat until they’re covered in white ash before spreading them out evenly. For gas grills, open the lid, ignite the burners, and let the grill preheat. It's important to preheat the grill for about 10 to 15 minutes to ensure the grates are hot enough for proper searing. Once the grill is hot, lightly oil the grates using a paper towel dipped in vegetable oil and held with tongs, which helps prevent sticking and promotes those desirable grill marks. If you're cooking foods that require different heat levels, you can create heat zones by placing coals or turning burners on one side only, giving you both direct and indirect heat areas for more controlled cooking. Once everything is set, the grill is ready for use.
